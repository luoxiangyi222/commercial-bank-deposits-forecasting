"Residents comprise Singapore citizens and permanent residents.  Based on mid-year Labour Force Survey except for Census of Population 2000 and General Household Survey 2005.  To facilitate comparison with 2008, 2007 Labour Force Survey data have been adjusted based on Singapore Department of Statistics revised population estimates (released in February 2008) which exclude Singapore residents who have been away from Singapore for a continuous period of 12 months or longer.  Data from year 2020 are classified based on Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) 2020.  Data before year 2020 which were coded based on earlier versions of the SSIC were mapped to SSIC 2020 as far as possible to facilitate data comparability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
