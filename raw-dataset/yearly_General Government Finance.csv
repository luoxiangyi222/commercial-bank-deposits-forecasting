"Data refer to the Government's financial year, which begins on 1 April of the current year and ends on 31 March of the following year.  Presentation format of the table follows that of the National Summary Data Page for Singapore, which disseminates the data prescribed by the International Monetary Fund's Special Data Dissemination Standards.  Data in the table represent a broader definition of Government revenues and receipts than what are permissible for Government spending as presented in each year's Budget Statement.  This is because some revenues and receipts accrue to the Government's past reserves, which cannot be drawn on without the approval of the President.  The data prior to FY 2015 follow the IMF Government Financial Statistics Manual (GFSM), i.e., GFSM 2001.  Data from FY 2015 follow the latest IMF Government Financial Statistics Manual (GFSM), GFSM 2014, which is an update from the previous GFSM 2001.  Details on the differences in the reporting format for GFSM 2014 and GFSM 2001 can be found in IMF's website http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/gfs/manual/aboutgfs.htm.  General government finance includes budgetary and extra-budgetary accounts.  Figures may not add up due to rounding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
