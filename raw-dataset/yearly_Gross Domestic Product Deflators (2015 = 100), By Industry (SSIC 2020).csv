Gross Domestic Product:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Aggregate value of the goods and services produced in the economic territory of Singapore. The GDP estimates are compiled based on the output (or production), expenditure and income approaches. See Output-based GDP, Expenditure-based GDP and Income-based GDP.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gross Domestic Product Deflators:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A broad measure of the change in the overall level of prices of the goods and services that make up GDP. The deflators are derived as the ratio of the nominal value of a component of GDP to its corresponding real value, with the reference year index set at 100.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Value Added:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gross value added is derived by the output or income approach. 
The output approach measures value added as output less intermediate consumption.  Output refers to the value of goods and services produced  while intermediate consumption is value of goods and services consumed as inputs by a process of production, e.g. materials, utilities, fuel, rental paid for premises and equipment, banking and financial charges and other operating costs.
The income approach derives value added as the sum of incomes generated from the domestic production of goods and services, which comprise gross operating surplus, remuneration and taxes (less subsidies) on production. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
